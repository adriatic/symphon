# Software Requirements

Software requirements documents provide an important map of the product being built, the features that will be included and much more.

This roadmap helps to keep the technical and non-technical team on the same wavelength as to what the expectations are. It helps to ensure that the product is built meeting the needs whether it’s for internal purposes, for users or clients. [^1]

   2.1 User Needs: Explain the user needs for this software.

   2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies: What assumptions are you making that could cause an error in your approach? 
    Is the project reliant on any other factors that could affect the development of the software?


### 3. System Features and Requirements

   3.1 Functional Requirements: Take time to define the functional requirements that are essential for the software to build.

   3.2 External Interface Requirements: Are there any UX and UI requirements that you must keep in mind as you build?
