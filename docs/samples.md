# Samples

While Symphony project has some ambitious goals, the initial set of deliverables is quite modest: create a collection of full stack samples where Strapi app is as the backend, connected with many frontends (one for each front end framework Strapi customers care about). The backend side is just a minimal skeleton, sufficient support the Identity Management feature we plan to illustrate.
