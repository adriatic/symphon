Strapi, defined as the leading open-source headless CMS, is 100% Javascript, fully customizable and developer-first. Symphony is a "full-stack application", specifically designed to show Strapi in as many contexts as possible. In contrast with Strapi **tutorials and blogs**, Symphony is a real distributed application utilizing Strapi based back end, combined with many distributed services, demonstrating how to use the information in Strapi Guides, how to write multiple Strapi plugins, how to use some of the key Identity Management Services, etc.

At the moment we envision that Symphony will be a part of the **[Strapi Write for the Comunity](https://strapi.io/write-for-the-community)** effort.
