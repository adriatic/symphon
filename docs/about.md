Symphony is the code name for the project proposing to build a relatively complex distributed application intended to become a part of the Strapi community created advanced education tool. It is assumed that a group of Strapi Community volunteers will participate in all aspects of Symphony creation:

- [Architecture](https://adriatic.github.io/symphony-docs/architecture/)
- [Design](https://adriatic.github.io/symphony-docs/design/)
- [Implementation](https://adriatic.github.io/symphony-docs/implementation)
- [Deployment](https://adriatic.github.io/symphony-docs/deployment)

Since the Symphony app aims to illustrate all modern concepts (starting with Identity Management - aka Authentication and Authorization) we plan to present the use of several alternative services (AUTH0, AWS AIM, OKTA, Microsoft IAM). Similarly we plan to make use of several available variants of any other service that are of importance to our app.
